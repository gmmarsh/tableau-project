# tableau-project
data preparation for upload to Tableau
I pulled all the ride data for 2023 and randomly chose a 1000 n sample.
Pandas was used to handle missing data values, duplicates and create calculated fields such as distance, duration and speed.
Pandas was also used to calculate Z-Scores for distance, duration and speed.

The visualization porttion of this project was carried out using Tableau.
